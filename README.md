**Data Collection:**
Use Yahoo Finance to gather historical data for the ETF and its underlying assets. Use your discretion to pick a reasonable time frame.

**Python Implementation:**
Write a Python program that:

•	Reads the ETF's historical data from Yahoo Finance.

•	Based on the ETF's documentation and its investment strategy, simulate the ETF's returns over the given timeframe.

•	Generate the time series of the ETF's returns.

**Visualization:**

Generate plots that visualize the ETF's performance over time. Ensure your plots are clear, labeled, and easy to interpret.

**Analysis:**

Compare the replicated performance of the ETF with the actual performance data from Yahoo Finance.
Discuss any discrepancies or patterns you notice.

**Report Writing:**

Alongside your code and plots, prepare a brief report discussing your methodology, findings, and any challenges you encountered. This will help in understanding your thought process and the steps you took.
